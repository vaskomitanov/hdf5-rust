# Changelog

## 0.7.0

### Changed
- Removed dynamic deps, added static only linking to hdf5 and zip libs


## 0.6.1

### Added

- Implement `Default` for `H5D_layout_t`, `H5D_alloc_time_t`, `H5T_cset_t`,
  `H5D_fill_time_t`, `H5D_fill_value_t` (based on what their values are set
  to in default property lists).
- Derive `Debug` for `ErrorFrame` and `ErrorStack`.
- Implement `Display` for `TypeDescriptor`.
- Implement `Dimension` for `[Ix]`, `&[Ix]`, `[Ix; N]` and `&[Ix; N]`.

### Changed

- `h5check!`, `h5lock!`, `h5try!`, `h5call!` and `h5check()` are now public.
- `globals` module containing HDF5 runtime constants is now also public.
- Switch to using 1.0 versions of `syn`, `quote` and `proc-macro2` (which
  required a bit of a rewrite of `hdf5-derive`).
- Bump `ascii` to 1.0, update `hdf5-types` to be compatible.
- Bump other dependencies to their latest versions (`parking_lot` to 0.10,
  `ndarray` to 0.13, `bitflags` to 1.2, `lazy_static` to 1.4,
  `libloading` to 0.6, `winreg` to 0.7).
- Remove implementations of deprecated `Error::description()`.
- Switch to `trybuild` instead of `compiletest_rs` for derive-macro testing;
  enable full tests (including hdf5-derive) on both AppVeyor and Travis.
- Update the minimum Rust version to 1.40 (because of `ndarray` and `libloading`).

### Fixed

- Use `H5_free_memory()` instead of `libc::free()` to free HDF5-allocated
  resources if possible (1.8.13+); this fixes some deallocation errors.
- Fix wrong `H5D_DONT_FILTER_PARTIAL_CHUNKS` constant value.
- `H5Z_filter_t` is changed to `c_int` (was wrongfully set to `hid_t`).

## 0.6.0

### Added

- Added support for HDF5 1.10.5 with bindings for new functions.
- `File::access_plist()` or `File::fapl()` to get file access plist.
- `File::create_plist()` or `File::fcpl()` to get file creation plist.
- Added high-level wrappers for dataset access H5P API (`plist::DatasetAccess`).
- Added `hdf5::is_library_threadsafe()` function.
- Added `Group::member_names()`.
- Added `Datatype::byte_order()`.
- Added `Dataset::num_chunks()` (1.10.5+).
- Added `Dataset::chunk_info()` (1.10.5+).

### Changed

- Changed `File` constructors, getting rid of string access modes:
  - `File::open(path, "r")` is now `File::open(path)`
  - `File::open(path, "r+")` is now `File::open_rw(path)`
  - `File::open(path, "w")` is now `File::create(path)`
  - `File::open(path, "x" | "w-")` is now `File::create_excl(path)`
  - `File::open(path, "a")` is now `File::append(path)`
- Also added `File::open_as(path, mode)` which accepts the mode enum.
- Rewritten `FileBuilder`: it no longer accepts userblock, driver etc;
  all of these parameters can be set in the corresponding FAPL / FCPL:
  - `FileBuilder::set_access_plist()` or `FileBuilder::set_fapl()` to
    set the active file access plist to a given one.
  - `FileBuilder::access_plist()` or `FileBuilder::fapl()` to get a
    mutable reference to the FAPL builder - any parameter of it can
    then be tweaked as desired.
  - `FileBuilder::with_access_plist()` or `FileBuilder::with_fapl()`
    to get access to the FAPL builder in an inline way via a closure.
  - Same as the three above for `create_plist` / `fcpl`.
- As a result, all of the newly added FAPL / FCPL functionality is
  fully accessible in the new `FileBuilder`. Also, driver strings
  are gone, everything is strongly typed now.
- It's no longer prohibited to set FCPL options when opening a file
  and not creating it -- it will simply be silently ignored (this
  simplifies the behavior and allows using a single file builder).
- Added an explicit `hdf5_types::string::StringError` error type,
  as a result `error-chain` dependency has been dropped.
- `hdf5::Error` is now convertible from `ndarray::ShapeError`;
  `hdf5::ResultExt` trait has been removed.
- Renamed `hdf5::hdf5_version()` to `hdf5::library_version()`.

### Fixed

- Replaced deprecated `std::mem::uninitialized` with `std::mem::MaybeUninit`.
- Fixed a serde-related problem with building `hdf5-sys` on Windows.

## 0.5.2

### Changed

- Allow chunk dimensions to exceed dataset dimensions for resizable datasets.
- Default HDF5 location should now be detected automatically on Fedora Linux.

## 0.5.1

### Added

- Added `Group::link_exists()`.
- Re-export `silence_errors()` at the crate root.
- Added `from_id()` unsafe method at the crate root.

### Changed

- Using `#[derive(H5Type)]` no longer requires adding `hdf5-types` as a dependency.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Added support for HDF5 1.10.
- Added Rust equivalents of HDF5 primitives: arrays, Unicode strings and ASCII strings â€“ all of
  them available in both fixed-size or variable-length flavours (`hdf5-types` crate).
- Added `H5Type` trait that unifies the types that can be handled by the HDF5 library. This trait
  is implemented by default for all scalar types, tuples, fixed-size arrays and all types in
  `hdf5-types` and can be used to create `Datatype` objects.
- Implemented `#[derive(H5Type)]` proc macro that allows for seamless mapping of user-defined
  structs and enums to their HDF5 counterparts.
- Added high-level wrappers for file-creation H5P API (`plist::FileCreate`) and
  file-access H5P API (`plist::FileAccess`), covering almost the entirety of
  FCPL and FAPL property list functionality.
- Various improvements and additions to `PropertyList` type.
- Added support for various file drivers (sec2/stdio/core/family/multi/split/log).
- Added support for MPIO driver (HDF5 has to be built with H5_HAVE_PARALLEL and
  the crate has to be built with "mpio" feature enabled).
- Added support for direct VFD driver (HDF5 has to be built with H5_HAVE_DIRECT).
- Added some missing bindings to `hdf5-sys`: driver-related FAPL bindings
  in h5p/h5fd (including MPIO and direct VFD drivers), MPIO bindings in h5p/h5f/h5fd.
- Added core reading/writing API in `Container`, with support for reading/writing scalars,
  1-d, 2-d, and dynamic-dimensional arrays, and raw slices. As a side effect, the main crate
  now depends on `ndarray`. `Dataset` now dereferences to `Container`.
- Added basic support for reading and writing dataset slices.
- When creating datasets, in-memory type layouts are normalized (converted to C repr).
- Added `packed` option to `DatasetBuilder` (for creating packed HDF5 datasets).
- All high-level objects now implement `Clone` (shallow copy, increases refcount).

### Changed

- Renamed `hdf5-rs` crate (importable as `h5`) to `hdf5` (importable simply as `hdf5`).
- Renamed `libhdf5-sys` crate to `hdf5-sys` (importable as `hdf5_sys`).
- Renamed GitHub repository to `aldanor/hdf5-rust`.
- Updated the bindings and tests to the latest HDF5 versions (1.10.4 and 1.8.21).
- The build system has been reworked from the ground up:
  - `hdf5-lib` crate has been removed; all of the build-time logic now resides
    in the build script of `hdf5-sys`.
  - The environment variables the build script reacts to are now `HDF5_DIR` and `HDF5_VERSION`.
  - `pkg-config` is now only launched on Linux.
  - On macOS, the build scripts detects Homebrew installations, for both 1.8 and 1.10 versions.
  - On Windows, we now scan the registry to detect official system-wide installations.
  - Dynamic linking now works with conda envs; `HDF5_DIR` can be now pointed to a conda env.
  - A few definitions from `H5pubconf.h` are now exposed as cfg definitions, like
    `h5_have_parallel`, `h5_have_threadsafe` and `h5_have_direct` (this requires us to
    locate the include folder and parse the header at build time).
- Various clean ups in `hdf5-sys`: implemented `Default` and `Clone` where
  applicable, moved a few types and methods to matching parent modules.
- Major refactor: trait-based type hierarchy has been replaced with a `Deref`-based
  hierarchy instead (53eff4f). `ID` and `FromID` traits have been removed. Traits like `Location`,
  `Object` and a few other have been replaced with real types (wrappers around HDF5 handles, same
  as the concrete types like `File`). Subtypes then dereference into parent types, so the
  user can user methods of the parent type without having to import any traits into scope
  (for instance, `File` dereferences into `Group`, which dereferences into `Location`,
  which dereferences into `Object`).
- Dataspaces and property lists can now be copied via `.copy()` method (instead of `.clone()`).

### Fixed

- `hbool_t` is now mapped to unsigned integer of proper size (either 1 byte or 4 bytes),
  depending on how the HDF5 library was built and on which platform.
- Added missing bindings for previous versions (mostly in `h5p` and `h5fd` modules).
- Querying the HDF5 error stack is now thread-safe.
- Error silencing (`silence_errors()`) is now thread-safe.
- Fixed wrong bindings for `H5AC_cache_config_t`.

### Removed

- Removed `hdf5-lib` crate (merged it into `hdf5-sys`, see above).
- Removed `remutex` crate, using locking primitives from `parking_lot` crate instead.
- `Container` trait has been removed, all of its functionality merged into `Group` type.

### Notes

- The version number jump is due to renaming crates `hdf5-rs` and `libhdf5-sys` to `hdf5` and
  `hdf5-sys`, respectively. Since there were already published crates with those names and
  the crates registry is meant to be immutable even if the crates are yanked, we had to
  bump the version so that it shadows all of the older versions.

## 0.2.0 (Apr 17, 2016)

### Added

- Full support of `msvc` target on Windows. CI tests on AppVeyor now use official reeases of HDF5
  binaries (1.8.16, VS2015, x86_x64). The `gnu` target are still unofficially supported but
  won't be tested.
- If `HDF5_LIBDIR` is not specified when building on Windows and `PATH` contains what looks like
  the `bin` folder of HDF5 installation, the library directory will be inferred automatically.
  The official HDF5 installers add the `bin` folder to user path, so the official MSVC releases
  should just work out of the box without having to set any environment variables.
- The library is now split into three crates: `hdf5-lib` (requests linkage to HDF5),
  `hdf5-sys` (contains bindings, requires `hdf5-lib` at build time in order to conditionally
  enable or disable certain HDF5 functionality), and `hdf5` (the user-facing crate, requires
  both lower-level crates at build time).
- Added `hdf5::hdf5_version` function.
- The minimum required version of the HDF5 library is now 1.8.4.
- Both `hdf5-sys` and `hdf5` crates can now use version attributes at compile time to
  enable/disable/change functionality. All functions and definitions that appeared in HDF5 versions
  past 1.8.4 are now conditionally enabled in `hdf5-sys`.
- Added bindings for HDF5 functions that were added in releases 1.8.15 and 1.8.16.
- Static global variables in HDF5 (H5E, H5P, H5T) are now linked based on HDF5 version and not
  the target platform (`_ID_g` variables were introduced in 1.8.14). When `msvc` target is used,
  the dllimport stub prefixes are also accounted for. The constants exposed by `hdf5-sys` are
  now of reference type and need to be dereferenced upon use (for `msvc`, they have to be
  dereferenced twice).

### Changed

- API simplification: many methods previously expecting `Into<String>` inputs now just take `&str`.
- `util::to_cstring` now takes `Borrow<str>` instead of `Into<String>` so as to avoid
  unnecessary allocations, and the return value is now wrapped in `Result` so that interior
  null bytes in input strings trigger an error.

### Fixed

- Fixed dangling pointer problems when strings were being passed as pointers to the C API.
- Fixed target path not being passed correctly in `Container::link_soft`.

## 0.1.1 (July 2015)

Initial public version.
